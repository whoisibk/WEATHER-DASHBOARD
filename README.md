The Weather Dashboard is a single-page web application that helps users stay updated with real-time weather information. Users can search for a city to view its current weather conditions and a 5-day forecast. To make the experience more personal, users can also add cities to their favorites list, which is saved using localStorage for easy access on return visits.

This project was built as part of a school assignment to practice modern JavaScript concepts including:

Asynchronous JavaScript for fetching weather data via APIs.

Form validation to ensure user input is correct before making requests.

LocalStorage for saving searches and favorites across sessions.

Modular JavaScript for cleaner, reusable, and maintainable code.

The app provides a hands-on experience with frontend development, combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive and user-friendly weather tool.



### API INTEGRATION
ENSURE to replace "YOUR_API_KEY" with your actual OpenWeather API key.
